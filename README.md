# Life Expectancy

This project was created for learning to be a Data Scientist on the Codecademy portal. This program explores the relationship between life expectancy at birth and GDP for each country in the dataset.

The included files are the Python code, the text version of the code, and the data used for the analysis.

The main project was created by [adoria93](https://github.com/adoria93). You can view it via the [link](https://github.com/adoria93/Life-Expectancy-and-GDP/tree/master).

## Features

This project improved the architecture of the application by dividing the application into modules, added comments to improve understanding of the code, and added a Makefile to run the app.py file as an executable in the console.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for visualizing 2D and 3D graphics data.
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) to create statistical graphs.
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) for data processing and analysis.

## Starting

The following Makefile commands are used to run the project:

- `make run` to just run the app.py executable
- `make build` to make the app.py file executable.
- `make start` to make the app.py file executable and run it.
- `make upgrade` to update dependencies installed via the pip package manager.
- `make install` to install the required dependencies for the application to work.
